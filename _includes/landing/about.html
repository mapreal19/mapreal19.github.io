          Hello! I'm a Computer Scientist with experience in web development and agile practices. Ruby on Rails is my framework of choice. Fell in love with the Ruby way of doing things and its syntax. I always try to do the Red/Green/Refactor cycle on the code I write. I can work on the full stack, although I feel more comfortable in the backend.

          I enjoy working remotely. I feel more focused and can get things done faster. Also, it gives me more free time to spend with my family, friends, learning, exercising or experimenting with new technologies that could make my job more fun/productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          My other fields of interest are neuroscience and psychology. What I learnt helped me to understand and manage my own emotions and the emotions of others. I became a better person.
