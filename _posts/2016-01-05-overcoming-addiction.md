# Overcoming Addiction

<br>  

Addiction is very present in our society these days. We may be addicted to
substances, like smoking, food, alcohol, or to internet, gambling, sex, etc.
But the worst thing is, not knowing when you’re addicted.

So once you recognize that you’re addicted and have committed yourself to stop.
What’s the next step?

<br>

**Repetition** of the new behavior.

<br>

You must get used to not using the substance. Remember that maybe you've been smoking for several years. Your brain has carved a path where he is used to smoking. Not choosing that path will require a
huge amount of willpower.

But, the more you do it, the easier it’ll become. Think about walking through
the snow. The first time will be hard, the second time hard too, but not as
much as the first one. The 1000th time will be easy, since the path is already there.

You had, in fact, rewired your brain with this new healthy alternative.

Also, be sure to have a handful of new activities to distract you from your
addiction. Since, you cannot sit there thinking about not smoking ([Ironic Process Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory)). You know what happens if
I tell you not to think about a pink elephant...

Dr. Marc D. Lewis explains it [here](https://youtu.be/MBPBcJlZlsA?t=2100) (check min. 35) why
trying not to think about doing something usually fails.

Finally, I'll share with you some tips that may help you:

- Improve your social life. See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg).

- Exercise.

- Pursue your purpose.

- Meditation. Seriously, learn to meditate. Daniel Goleman explains it [here](https://youtu.be/HTfYv3IEOqM?t=1524) a simple exercise that you can do.

- Ask for help from your physician. Beware that you can't go cold turkey with some
substances like alcohol.

Come on guys, you can do it! &#128170;
