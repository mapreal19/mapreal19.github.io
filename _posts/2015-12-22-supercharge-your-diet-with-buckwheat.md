# Supercharge your Diet with Buckwheat

Recently, a friend of mine insisted on me giving Buckwheat a try. I’ve never
heard of it and I was really surprised by its composition:

- Protein 13 g

- Total Carbohydrate 72 g

- vit. B1	0.101 mg (8%)

- vit. B2	0.425 mg (28%)

- vit. B3	7.020 mg (47%)

- vit. B6 0.210 mg (16%)

- Iron	2.2 mg (18%)

- Magnesium	231 mg (62%)

- Phosphorus	347 mg (50%)

- Potassium	460 mg (10%)

- Zinc	2.40 mg (24%)

It looks like a great addition into our diets. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find
it on my local stores. Good thing my friend Anton was willing to send me a
package directly from Mother Russia! (world leader in buckwheat production).


Didn't know Buckwheat comes with great pictures though :)
