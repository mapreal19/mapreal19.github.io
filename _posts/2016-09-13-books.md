Hi!

Here I'll share the books that made me a great impact in my life. Some of them
inspired me to write my own book *Refactor your Mind*.

There are books out there than can change and literally save your life, so keep
reading! One of the best advices I've received is hearing this quote from Jim Rohn:

> Read all the books you need to read

Through books you'll learn from others and add all those years of experience to
your own life.
